So, I'll just talk about current progress here, so no one later, including me, gets lost.

I'm working on a deployment for ../devlop.yml, but the images mount needs to be shared between two containers. So I'm working on a deingle deployment for all relevant containers. It's not working yet, due to back not finding mongo I think.

Wish me luck!
